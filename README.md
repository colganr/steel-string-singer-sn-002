This project is intended for hobbyists. Amp builders for profit may use the information here, but I'd encourage a reasonable donation for my efforts as it is a win-win-win for the customer, your business, and myself for giving you the tools for the sale. If you find this information useful, please consider adding to my virtual tip jar here: [https://www.paypal.me/thetonegeek](https://www.paypal.me/thetonegeek)


This project is to create a tube amplifier chassis that can be compared to a Dumble Steel String Singer s/n #002. I'm sharing these drawings free of charge with hopes to inspire someone to persue a custom chassis for their tube amplifier goal. These drawings can be used as an educational reference, but is also complete enough to fabricate as-is.

### Notes about Fabrication
When finding a sheet metal fabricator for a quote, they will likely want to know:
* Overall dimensions
* The type of metal
* The thickness of the metal
* Radius bend parameters
* Welding assembly and considerations
* Quantity
* Finishing

I use CAMMetals in Connecticut and recommend their work. I can't guarentee they will take you on as a customer but it doesn't hurt to get a quote. http://www.cammmetals.com/

For this project
* 23.75" x 2.5" x 8.05"
* 5052 Aluminum
* .125" Thick
* .125" Radius bends
* Welding considerations is in the "Reference-Pictures" section of this project. The "sides" will be a second part to tack welded in place. No full weld beads required as the tack welding is enough. 
* Price breaks usually are given after quantity of 2x. Anything in the 10x range will give you the best price breaks.
* SSS #002 has a brushed finish that can be directly silk screened. Some folks may prefer having the chassis powder coated silver but it is not required unless it's your personal preference. For powder coat color, I like Prismatic Powder's polyester "Tin Can" for that matte silver look that's not overly metallic in appearance. [https://www.prismaticpowders.com/shop/powder-coating-colors/PMB-8126/tin-can](https://www.prismaticpowders.com/shop/powder-coating-colors/PMB-8126/tin-can)

Send along the *.ipt and the *.stp files to the fabricator as well as the Reference-Pictures. Some fabricators also do powder coating and silk screening of the artwork. 

### Notes about Silk Screening
You will need the following fonts if you want to modify the *.svg artwork. I cannot upload these fonts because some of them are copyright protected but a quick Google search will likely provide you what you need. 

```sh
BD Geminis
sans-serif
Conthrax
Cooper Black
Xolonium
Goudy Text MT
```
If your chassis is powder coated, provide the silk screener the Manage Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS/SDS) so the silk screener knows which ink to use. The safety sheet will identify the contents of the powder coat so the ink will adhere properly to it. If you use "Tin Can" powder coat, it's polyester based. 

There is usually a setup fee and with this fee, the silk screener might adjust the artwork so they can align the holes the way they prefer so the artwork is laid down straight. 

I use Korzon Screen Printing in Connecticut [https://www.korzonscreenprinting.com/](https://www.korzonscreenprinting.com/) I cannot guarentee they will take you on as a customer but it doesn't hurt to get a quote.

### Notes about Circuit Boards & BOM
I have made a layout that matches the chassis for this project. I used DIY Layout Creator Freeware [http://diy-fever.com/software/diylc/](http://diy-fever.com/software/diylc/) because the .diy files can be uploaded to Hoffman Amplifiers. Hoffman Amplifiers made it even easier to order by adding this project to their board set [https://hoffmanamps.com/MyStore/catalog/MiscEyeletBoard.htm](https://hoffmanamps.com/MyStore/catalog/MiscEyeletBoard.htm)

Erwin (https://ampgarage.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=4207) Has freely contributed his PCB files to the project! Thank you, Erwin! You can upload the *.ZIP files directly to sites like https://jlcpcb.com/ to have PCBs manufactuered for this project. 

### Notes about the Head Cabinet/Shell
I don't think anyone is building custom cabs at the moment. You might have good luck reaching out to KC at [guitarcabinetsdirect.com. ](https://guitarcabinetsdirect.com/). The headshell size is 12" Heigh wood-to-wood, 10.25" depth, 24" width at the face opening (~25.5 width total), and 2.5" for the face opening to the bottom bar of the "grill".  

### Additional Information
Always double check mine, and your work. I am not responsible for any loses as I'm providing this information for free and educational purposes. I am confident these drawings and files will produce an excellent chassis as-is and I have a bit of experience now with designing and outsourcing my own chasiss. Enjoy and good look! Drop me a message if you have any questions or you want to let me know how your chassis went!
