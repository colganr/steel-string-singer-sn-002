Please use the Mouser project order in the parent folder for the majority of small electronic parts.
For the additional parts, the spreadsheet will _help_ with Banzai and Tube-Town orders.

This was compiled by [timrobertson100](mailto:timrobertson100@gmail.com) during his build with thanks to Erwin for assistance over email.
Feel free to ask questions!

Notes:

1. Smooth and slim clone parts omitted
2. This was prepared during a 2x6L6 build, so some quantities should be adjusted. This is indicated on sheet where necessary
3. Hardware here is added just for a suggestion. Use standard M3 hardware which is known to work well (larger nuts may be too big in places) 
4. Add wire of your choice. Erwin and Tim use cloth wire for heaters (Fender style), and Tim also uses this for signal wiring
